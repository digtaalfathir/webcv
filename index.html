        A highly motivated and accomplished Electrical Engineering Education student with a strong background in robotics, particularly in developing and programming humanoid robots for soccer competitions. With over three and a half years
        of academic and practical experience at Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta, I have demonstrated exceptional leadership, project management, and technical skills. As the Programming Coordinator, I successfully led the team to achieve 2nd
        place in the KRSBI-Humanoid national competition in 2024 and 3rd place in 2023. Additionally, I have been recognized for my innovative contributions, receiving funding in the Student Creativity Program (PKM) and National Student
        Scientific Week in 2023. My expertise includes microcontroller programming, digital logic design, control systems, and power electronics. I am dedicated to continuous learning and applying my skills to develop advanced technological
        solutions and contribute to the field of electrical engineering education.
